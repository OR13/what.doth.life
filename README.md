What doth life? Are we just fleshy blips in some meaningless stew of cosmic oblivion? Or is it vice-reversa? Is our every trollop through fate's garden infused with a mystic...

Hey, bunghole, cease that inner yapping.

I don't want no trouble, mister.

Freak! If you didn't want trouble, you shouldn't have wandered into Burbury, Connecticut.

Please, I'm just a simple seeker on a spirit quest to discover... What doth life?

We don't cottton to freaks here in Burbury, and we's done hate freaks with open, unquenchable cans of philosophical thirst-worms.

You're gonna regret that.You've shattered my shakhashuri.

I hope y'all can play it 3 feet up your ass.

Don't know. But I'd sure like to try.

What you gonna do, bird-beast, fly away on your cuddle bone?

Yeah,cuddle this b-b-b-b-b-bone.

Best stay away from that weirdo. You'll catch the feline AIDS.

Yeah, from me. M-m-m-meow.

Do yourself a solid. Walk away. Just walk away.

What's the matter, ch-ch-chicken? Frightened? Or do you prefer, what's the matter, chicken? F-f-frightened?

Please walk away. You may need my help someday. Walk away.

Yeah, help me punch your neck off.

Wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-wel-welcome to Burbury. What are you looking for?

Well, ma'am, I suppose I'm seeking a deeper strata of truth. Perhaps you can answer the one question that has plagued thinkers for all time. What doth life?

One moment,please.
